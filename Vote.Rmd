# Model

The study uses a generalized linear mixed logistic model with random effects across states as below:


$$Y_{ij}  \sim  \text{Bernoulli}(\lambda_{ij})$$

$$log(\lambda_{ij}) = \mu + X \beta + state_i + Z_{ij}$$

Let we assume that the covariance matrix $\Sigma_{state}$ is among voters for state level and $\Sigma_{Z}$ is the covariance matrix among individuals within state level.

$$state_i \sim N(0, \sigma_{state}^2 \Sigma_{state})$$
$$Z_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma_{Z}^2\Sigma_{Z})$$

And 

1. $Y_{ij}$ is  whether vote for Trump or not for ith state, j-th voter. 

2. $\lambda_{ij}$ is the chance of vote for Trump.

3. $\mu$ is the intercept, X are covariates,

4. $\beta$ are  coefficients. 

5. State is the random effect for state level.

6. Z is random effect for invidual level. 


As binary outcome is appropriate for logistic model, and random effect across states require random effect model, so the GLMM model is appropriate instead of linear regression model. Also, model diagnostics are used to verify the model is valid.



# Results


```{r,eval=F}
library(haven)
library(tidyverse)
raw_data <- read_dta("inputs/data/ns20200625/ns20200625.dta")
raw_data <- labelled::to_factor(raw_data)
# Just keep some variables
reduced_data <-   raw_data %>%  select(interest,
         vote_2020,
         gender,
         race_ethnicity,
         state,
         age)  %>%  mutate( 
      
      Trump = as.integer(vote_2020 == "Donald Trump"),
      gender = tolower(gender),
      race = ifelse(race_ethnicity== "White","White",ifelse(race_ethnicity == "Black, or African  American","Black","Other"))) %>% select(Trump, gender, age, race, state) %>% na.omit() 


raw_data2 <- read_dta("inputs/data/usa_00002.dta")

raw_data2 <- labelled::to_factor(raw_data2)

a1 <- match(raw_data2$stateicp,c(tolower(state.name),"district of columbia"))

reduced_data2 %>% 
  
  rename('gender' = 'sex') %>%
  
  mutate(  race = ifelse(race == "white","White",   ifelse(race == "black/african american/negro","Black","Other")),
          
           state = c(state.abb, "DC")[a1],
           
           age = as.numeric(ifelse(age == "90 (90+ in 1980 and 1990)", "90",age))) %>% 
  filter(  18 <= age & age <= 93 ) %>%  select(gender, age, race, state) %>% na.omit()

```

```{r,eval=F}
library(glmmTMB)

fit = glmmTMB(Trump ~ age + gender + race + (1 | state), data = reduced_data,
                      family = binomial(link = "logit"))
prob <- predict(fit, reduced_data2,type="response")

p <- mean(round(prob,1))
s <- sqrt(p*(1-p)/5000)
c(p-1.96*s,p+1.96*s)
```


Table 1 Forecasting Trump's winning probability with 95% confidence interval 

|Variable                  |Forecast    |
|:----------------------|:-------------|
|Probability  |0.54         |
|S.E.        |0.01         |
|95%  CI |(0.52,0.56) |

Using the model, the main results are shown in the table 1 which is the forecasting Trump's winning probability with 95% confidence interval, so the results show that  Trump expected to win about 54% vote in 2020 US Election, that we are 95% confident that this predicted proportion of vote fall into the range from (52%, 56%). As 52% is still higher than 50%, so this study forecasts that Trump would win the 2020 US Election.

# Discussion

This sutdy mainly uses a generalized linear mixed logistic model with random effects across states to forecast the US 2020 election, it was found that Trump expected to win about 54% vote in 2020 US Election, that we are 95% confident that this predicted proportion of vote fall into the range from (52%, 56%). And because the 52% is still higher than 50%, so this study forecasts that Trump would win the 2020 US Election. However, besides the findings, there are still some weaknesses in this study. For examples, the non-response biases in the survey data, the data cleaning processes and etc, in future work, these issues could be invistigated to improve the performance of the model and fndings in this study.
